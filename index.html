		 <h3>More about us</h3>
		<p>Pimp up my wall is born from the firm belief that street art is a form art that everyone can relate to. Though it has been limited to the streets until now, it's growing popularity - with artists such as Banksy - has made it more important than ever for it to be accessible.</p>
		<p>But we also live in a world of customization. Being able to be different than the others, having something that is just ours. Even if art work are usually unique in the first place we wtanted to take that even further. And that's how Pimp up my wall was born : allowing you to find the right street artist for you and get a unique piece just for you!</p>
	</div>
	<div class="container" id="whatwedo">
		<h3>What we do</h3>
		<p>We work as a third party between you and the artist you fall in love with. We work with a lot of different artists with different styles and using different techniques to allow you to find the one that feets your aesthetic and would be the best for your project. Once you have decided which artist you prefer you can ask for a personal appointment and get a quote depending on what you want.</p>
		<p id="text-bold">If every goes well, you should get your new piece of art in no time !  </p>
